## Special Notes

1. ___To install recharts run:___

   - `npm install recharts --force` (if I got error)
   - `npm install recharts` (otherwise)

2. ___If you see the following warning, ignore it for now.___

   - `Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

3. For the ___dashboard___, you can modify the data provided in `data.json` and you can load the data the way you want. 

4. __[optional]__ To display ___ratings___, you can use `font-awesome stars` or you can use `react ratings website` [___class component___ might make it confusing] <br> [react rating github](https://github.com/dreyescat/react-rating)
   - [react rating demo](https://dreyescat.github.io/react-rating/)

``` Terminal
npm install --save react-rating
```

``` Terminal
install font-awesome for react
```

``` JavaScript
import Rating from 'react-rating';
import { faStar } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";
<Rating
    initialRating={3.5}
    emptySymbol={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faStar} />}
    fullSymbol={<FontAwesomeIcon style={{color: 'goldenrod'}} icon={faStar} />}
    readonly
></Rating>
```

Please note, you will see an warning while using react rating <br> 
`react-dom.development.js:86 Warning: Using UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in strict mode is not recommended and may indicate bugs in your code. See https://reactjs.org/link/unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.`

## Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check (`Fix vulnerabilities`)

- [Help, npm audit says I have a vulnerability in react-scripts!](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174 "facebook/create-react-app - github")
- [github Dependabot alert: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71282206/github-dependabot-alert-inefficient-regular-expression-complexity-in-nth-check "stackoverflow.com")

**[ðŸ”¼Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### `Solutions`

`npm audit` says there's a warning about ___vulnerabilities___ in my project
Open `package.json`. You will find this:

``` JSON
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  }
```

Take `react-scripts` and move it to `devDependencies` (if you **don't have** it, **create it**):

``` JSON
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
  },
```

Then, ensure you run `npm audit --production` rather than `npm audit`.

This will fix your warnings.
